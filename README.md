## Get started
1. Create an API key at [AlphaVantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/)
2. Build and run the app and open the settings editor and input the key.
3. Type in some symbol names. This starts downloads of days in the background.
4. Open the downloader to download minutes, this is very slow with the free version of AlphaVantage.
